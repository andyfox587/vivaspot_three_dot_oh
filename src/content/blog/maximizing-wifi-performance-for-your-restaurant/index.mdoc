## The Importance of Quality WiFi Equipment

Selection of the right WiFi unit for your restaurant can maximize the Internet speed and performance for your customers and also serve as a powerful marketing tool for your business.

## The Problem with Standard ISP Equipment

The typical WiFi unit provided as part of the service package you receive from your Internet Provider (e.g. Comcast, Verizon, Spectrum) is usually a low-end, offshore unit that provides a minimal feature set that cannot be adjusted by the merchant.

VivaSpot WiFi appliances provide merchants with a number of powerful features that improve performance, range, bandwidth utilization and security. This is in addition to the powerful marketing features that the VivaSpot Cloud provides.
